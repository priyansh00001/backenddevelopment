database se jbb bhi baat hoti hai async await lagana is a good practice and uske sath sath hame try & catch blocks ka use krna chahiye 

Two important points about database connectivity: 

1. When connecting to databases, handling potential data-not-found scenarios is essential. Employ try/catch blocks or promises to manage errors or we can also use promises.

key to remember : ( wrap in try-catch )

2. Database operations involve latency, and traditional synchronous code can lead to blocking, where the program waits for the database query to complete before moving on. So, we should async/await which allows for non-blocking execution, enabling the program to continue with other tasks while waiting for the database response. 

key to remember :  ( always remember the database is in another continent, so use async await)


agar env file mein changes karenge toh hame hamesha server restart krna padega because env file read nhi krta nodemon 


aur hamesha jo bhi files me ham error show krenge toh most efficient ye hai ki error message different likhe taki hame pta chal jaye ki kis file me error aa rhi hai and debugging mein bhi easy hoga
